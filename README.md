# Revive the Revolt 
## Bring back the original Revolt home menu

Do you dislike "Stoat"? does it just not roll off the tongue nicely? (No hate to the Stoat development team, of course) Well then, you're in luck!

Here's how to install Revive the Revolt (DEPRECATED CLIENT)!

---

> 1. Open "Stoat".
> 2. Open the development console (CTRL + SHIFT + I)
> 3. Grab the contents of `plugin.revolt.js` and paste it into the dev console.
> 4. You might need to type `allow pasting` beforehand, so make sure to do that.

Enjoy, my fellow gamers!
